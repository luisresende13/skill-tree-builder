**Description**
The current `README.md` file contains only basic instructions for running the project locally. To improve the developer experience and make onboarding easier, the documentation should be expanded.

**Tasks**
- [ ] Add a "Project Overview" section explaining the purpose of the application.
- [ ] Add a "Features" section listing the key functionalities.
- [ ] Add a "Project Structure" section briefly explaining the purpose of the main directories (`components`, `hooks`, `services`).
- [ ] Add a "Contributing" section with guidelines for new contributors (e.g., code style, pull request process).

**Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] The `README.md` is updated with the new sections.
- [ ] The documentation provides a clear and comprehensive overview of the project.
