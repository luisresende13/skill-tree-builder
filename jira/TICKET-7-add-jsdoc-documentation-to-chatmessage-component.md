**Description**
The `ChatMessage.tsx` component is responsible for rendering both user and model messages, including complex conditional logic for checklists. However, it lacks any JSDoc comments, making it difficult for other developers to understand its props and behavior.

**Tasks**
- [ ] Add a file-level JSDoc comment explaining the component's overall purpose.
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for the `ChatMessageProps` interface, describing each prop.
- [ ] Add comments within the component to clarify the more complex conditional rendering logic, especially for the checklist.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] The `ChatMessage.tsx` file is fully documented with JSDoc.
- [ ] The props and their purposes are clearly explained.
- [ ] The documentation makes it easier to understand and maintain the component.
