**Description**
The `Checklist.tsx` component renders a list of items with checkboxes. It is used within `ChatMessage.tsx` to display interactive checklists. The component currently lacks JSDoc comments, which makes it harder to understand its props and expected data structure.

**Tasks**

- [ ] Add a file-level JSDoc comment explaining the component's purpose.
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for the `ChecklistProps` interface, describing each prop (`checklist`, `onChecklistChange`, `disabled`).

**Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] The `Checklist.tsx` file is fully documented with JSDoc.
- [ ] The props and their purposes are clearly explained.
- [ ] The documentation improves the clarity and maintainability of the component.
